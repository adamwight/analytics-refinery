Defines reusable datasets for aggregated interlanguage navigation data.
Use this dataset in your coordinator.xml files by setting:

    ${start_time}                   - the initial instance of your data.
                                      Example: 2014-04-01T00:00Z
    ${interlanguage_data_directory} - Path to the interlanguage data directory.
                                      Example: /wmf/data/wmf/interlanguage

    <!--
    The interlanguage_navigation_daily dataset contains aggregated pageviews
    that are referred from another wiki within the same project family but
    in a different language.  This allows the tracking of inter-language user
    navigation.

    Note that we do not use “${...}” but “${"$"}{...}", as dataset files are
    passed to EL twice in cascade, and in the first EL level, ${MONTH}
    evaluates to the string “${MONTH}”. Hence, we escape the dollar sign in
    “${....}" to “${"$"}{...}”. At the first EL level, “${"$"}” gets turned
    into a dollar sign, and “{...}”  is just passed along. Hence, we arrive
    at “${...}” as input for the second EL level. There, the variables hold
    their expected values, and we can start unpadding them.

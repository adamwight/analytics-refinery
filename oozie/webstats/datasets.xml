Defines reusable datasets for webstats.
Use this dataset in your coordinator.xml files by setting:

    ${start_time}     - the initial instance of your data.
                        Example: 2014-04-01T00:00Z
    ${webstats_data_directory}
                      - Path to directory where data is time bucketed.
                        Example: /wmf/data/wmf/webstats

        To unpad MONTH, DAY, and HOUR, we force coercion to a number by
        adding 0.

        Note that we do not use “${...}” but “${"$"}{...}", as dataset files are
        passed to EL twice in cascade, and in the first EL level, ${MONTH}
        evaluates to the string “${MONTH}”. Hence, we escape the dollar sign in
        “${....}" to “${"$"}{...}”. At the first EL level, “${"$"}” gets turned
        into a dollar sign, and “{...}”  is just passed along. Hence, we arrive
        at “${...}” as input for the second EL level. There, the variables hold
        their expected values, and we can start unpadding them.

# Coding conventions

* For files underneath ```bin```:
   * Use ```-``` as separator for filenames (like
     ```my-nice-cool-script```).

   * Do not use extensions for the used language (so no trailing
     ```.sh```, and no trailing ```.py```)

* For files outside of ```bin```:
  * Use ```_``` as separator for filenames (like
    ```my_nice_file.txt```).

  * Do use proper extensions there. (like trailing ```.xml```, or
    trailing ```.properties```)

* We do not like camelCase in variable names. Only use them in Java
  code, where they are somewhat standard.
